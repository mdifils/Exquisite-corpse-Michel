# Exquisite-corpse-Michel

## Description
This project is part of AI training at BeCode. The main goal is to learn Git workflow with contributors on GitHub.
We will be covering the following topics:
- [How to initialize a new repository and invite people to contribute to our project](#initialization)
- [How to contribute to a project](#contributions)
- [How to create a version of our project](#versionning)

---
## Initialization
1. Create a GitHub repository named "Exquisite-corpse-Your-Name" with a README file
2. Clone your repository on your computer : `$ git clone git@github.com:His-Name/Exquisite-corpse-His-Name.git`
3. Create a new branch "development" and Go to that new branch : `$ git checkout -b development`
4. Write 3 lines of texts in the README file.
5. Add the file to the staging index : `$ git add README.md`
6. Save the state of the file by making a commit : `$ git commit -m "message"`
7. Push the branch "development" : `$ git push origin development`
8. Invite your colleagues as contributors

Below is my story with the collaboration of others
=======

I am a junior developer at BeCode.
I have just started my training as an AI data operator.
I have met new friends and the name of our promotion is GNT-Arai-2.3.1

So, after that formal introduction, let me tell you a secret: 

I am tall but not so tall.
I am big but not so big.
I am smart but, but no but.

This add is from Minh

Never give up 
see the beautiful in things
Empower others and enjoy the magic

it might be hard, it might be long but it won't hurt you. Keep trying keep being annoyed but get up, every time! and in the end you will know what you have gained.
