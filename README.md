2. Clone your repository on your computer : `$ git clone git@github.com:His-Name/Exquisite-corpse-His-Name.git`
3. Create a new branch "development" and Go to that new branch : `$ git checkout -b development`
4. Write 3 lines of texts in the README file.
5. Add the file to the staging index : `$ git add README.md`
6. Save the state of the file by making a commit : `$ git commit -m "message"`
7. Push the branch "development" : `$ git push origin development`
